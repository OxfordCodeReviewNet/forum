# Oxford code reviews network
Want to get  your code reviewed?
Interested in reviewing some other researcher's code ?

This repository acts as a central place for organizing code reviews in the University of Oxford.
If you'd like your code to be reviewed by someone else, simply open an issue with a brief description of your code (language and context).
If you'd like to volunteer in reviewing some research code, you can just comment on the corresponding issue and register your interest!

## Code review guidelines
### Format
Ideally, the code review is carried out face to face, i.e the author and reviewer sit together in front of the code.
If not possible, there are at least two other options:
- Setup a [remote code review]()
- Using GitHub's code review tool
If you think of another way of conducting a code review or/and want to share your experience, we encourage you to open an issue to describe it!

### Location
The location of the code review (or the tool used for the remote meeting) is left to the author and reviewer to decide upon.

### Duration
It is recommended to keep the code review sessions relatively short (two hours maximum), as it can be a tiring exercise for both parties!
For most projects, this means only proposing a **part of you code** for review.



## What is a code review
A code review is simply the action of having a deep and critical look into somebody else's code.
This is common practice in the software industry, and more generally in the open source software development community, but still very
rarely happen in academia.
Typically, the author of the code sits down with one or several colleagues and walks them through the code, explaining design choices and implementation details.
the role of reviewers is to try to identify potential issues, but also highlight and ecourage the use of software good practices.

## Why code reviews?

A common saying in the software world is that the average number of bugs introduced per 1000 lines of code is around 15.
Although such metric isn't probably reliable, it illustrates the fact that **software almost never comes out perfect**, and that fixing bugs and issues is part of the software developement process.
This is true in industry, and this is true in academia.

By allowing your code to be reviewed, your make possible for a fresh pair of eyes to have a look around and detect potential flaws that you would never have imagined.
Having someone external to the project is also a great way of fixing bugs or understanding errors, as it forces the author to **explain the problem to someone that is unfamiliar with the code**.
Furthermore, several people can often come up with different solutions to a given problem, and may have widely different use of the same programming language
As a reviewer, you also have a lot to gain from this process, as it is likely that you will come across programming concepts and practices that are completely new to you.
Whether you are a seasoned programmer or a beginner, reviewing code is a great way of developing, sharpening and widening your programming skills!
